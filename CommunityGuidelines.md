# Foreword

The `rzLabs` *(formerly OpenRZ)* community was founded on the ideal of openly sharing documentation, tools, server_bin and asset in an effort to uplift the entire **RZ** community. That being said, all community members contribute on an immutably voluntary basis. So **always** remember the community members you interact with are **not in any way, shape or form** required to answer/help you at all. So, remember to always be respectful and thankful for the time and effort others invest into interacting with you.

# General Behavior and Conduct

## Conduct

In the community we ask that you abide by one guideline above all others. 

### The Golden Rule

**`Don't be a dick`**

This means exactly how it sounds. Treat other community members with respect first and foremost. If you must resort to name calling or other troll tactics, **be quiet**.

## Language

The primary language of the community is **`English`**

This means to request help or interact with the community [discord](https://discord.gg/73mGPjr) you will be required to post your request/message in **`English`** *(or at the very least, provide an english translation)*

> **Note:** _Any community request/message not in English or accompanied by an English translation will be deleted without notice_

# Discord

Interacting with the community [discord](https://discord.gg/73mGPjr) should always be considered a privilage and as previously mentioned you should always conduct yourself appropriately as a member of the community. Please review and always be mindful of the following guidelines.

## Cursing / Adult Language

Cursing and adult language must be used with discretion. While typical cursing is acceptable. _(That thing Gala did to Rappelz was fucking stupid)_ Overly targeted or excessive cursing/adult language _(Fuck you individual you can suck my body part)_ is absolutely not allowed in public channels. If you wish to speak in this manner please do so in the unmoderated channel.

## Discussion/Requesting Help

When speaking in public to any community members, remain polite and respectful. Follow the guidelines set in this document and make sure to post in the appropriate channel. e.g. _(general discussion in `#general-discussion` and so on)_

When requesting help. Understand we are excited and willing to help you. But, we still have personal lives to contend with. Make your request in the formally accepted manner and then respectfully wait. **never** expect or set time frames on receiving help. **Remember we are volunteers.** Otherwise, make sure your request has been posted in the appropriate place. e.g. `#requests` / `#help-discussion`

## Mentions (@ Pings)

Falling under our main tenant `The Golden Rule` we ask that all community members be respectful when using `@username` mentions. Every single member of `@everyone`  / `@Contributor` / `@Community Manager` / `@Organizer` / `@Founder`  are here on a voluntary basis. That being said, if you are unsure whether or not you should ping a community member, don't. If you do ping a community member, only do it once. Remain respectful of the time/effort others are willing to volunteer here.

## Messaging (DM)

When messaging another community member, always remain respectful of this persons time, they are not required at all to answer your or even consider answering you. Always remember they owe you nothing, keep your messages to the point and always, always be respectful.

**DO NOT EVER** message server developers/administrators etc unless they have given you permission to do so! Otherwise seek their public presences like EPVP/R101 or their own discord servers.

## Unmoderated

General spamming, trolling, nsfw content is not acceptable in any channel accept `#unmoderated` in that channel anything goes within reason. It is entirely unmoderated _(w/ the given exceptions of serious crimes including but not limited to; real life threats, doxxing and pedophillic materials)_ 

**Understand this means the community leadership will not act on any event/information presented in this channel.**

# Releasing

When posting any release for the community, please be mindful to post in the appropriate areas (e.g. `#tools` or `#clients`) of the discord / github. Releases must be original works (not including 3rd party softwares like server bins etc) or be released with provable permission from the original creator and/or all appropriately involved parties of the project. Also, always check the pinned messages of the release channel for any posting guide-lines that may be applicable.

> **Note:** Any releases not following their channels posting guide-lines will be removed without notice.

Also be aware, the rzLabs Community leadership assumes absolutely zero reponsibility for the implied/explicit content/quality or value of any posted works past verifying that any given post meets community guide-lines. You should not expect leadership or any community member to provide support for any releases made. *(This includes the original poster)*

> **Note:** Releasing content engineered and/or modified in such a way as to compromise the users security or safety is **strictly prohibited** and will result in **immediate** and **permenant** bans without notice.
